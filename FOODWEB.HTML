            A chocolate cake is a cake made with chocolate or cocoa. The
            ingredients are put into a bowl and mixed together; then the mixed
            ingredients are put into a cake tin and put in an oven until it is
            fully cooked. Then the cake is taken out of the oven and placed on a
            cooling stand. If the cake maker wants to, they can ice the cake,
            when it has cooled down, by spreading thick icing on it. Chocolate
            cakes are a sold in shops as well as made at home. They are a sweet
            food and should not be eaten all the time, which would be unhealthy.
